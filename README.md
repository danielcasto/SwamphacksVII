You love me, unconditionally
Say you never leave me, no matter what (ooh ooh ooh)
But I have a confession (ooh ooh, ooh, ooh na)
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend
Everytime you called I told you
Baby I'm working (no)
I was out doing my dirt (oh)
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone
So wrong
Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
But you probably believe you got a good man
I mean that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over I would
Instead of everything being all bad aeby everything will be all good
I don't wanna lose you but I know what I'm telling you ain't gonna' make you wanna stay
Probably just make you run away or mad enough to punch me in my face
I've been living like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it
I know, today is the day that I end all the lying and the playing and the bullshit
Girl, I'm sorry baby I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest
I confess
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Can you break it down (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) oh baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (don't leave me baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been going on so long
Girl I've been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
Every thing that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad
